1. Overview Of the Project
   Objectives: Prevent fraudulent transactions before they are completed.
               Detect fraudulent activities as early as possible.
               Achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
   
3. Key Activity
1. Data Collection
Objective: Gather comprehensive data on transactions and cardholder behavior.
Activities:
Collect transaction data, including amount, location, merchant, and time.
Gather cardholder information and historical transaction patterns.

2. Data Preprocessing
Objective: Prepare the collected data for analysis and modeling.
Activities:
Clean data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Normalize or standardize data to ensure consistency.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Understand the data and identify key patterns and relationships.
Activities:
Visualize data distributions and transaction patterns using plots and charts.
Identify correlations and potential indicators of fraud.

4. Model Development
Objective: Build and train models to detect fraudulent transactions.
Activities:
Select appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests, neural networks).
Train models on labeled data with known fraud outcomes.

5. Model Evaluation
Objective: Assess the performance of fraud detection models.
Activities:
Evaluate models using relevant metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
Perform validation on separate datasets to ensure robustness.
